Test coverage has been increased to 66% which is getting very close to the goal of 80%!\r\n\r\n### Added authorization and OctoPrint API Key security\r\nUser roles and permissions have been added in the backend. All API endpoints have been protected against unauthorized use. Also the OctoPrint API keys are not exposed automatically anymore! Much safer to use.\r\n\r\n### Group management\r\nWe now have the ability to manage printer groups in the frontend website. A missing feature is to be able to create groups and set their location in the Printer Grid. Coming asap\r\n\r\n### Packages updated\r\nImportant packages like `awilix` or `mongoose` got a major version update with slight breaking changes. All tests indicate green.\r\n\r\n### Job history\r\nTracking printer jobs in the past is really important. We've now got the History Store which is a simplified and generic version of the previous History Cache. The main change is that the database will automatically be adjusted and is the source of truth instead of the cache being the truth (design choice). This pattern has shown to be beneficial in the Printer and FileStore!\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Close nav after visiting OctoPrint by @davidzwa in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/49\r\n* Lay groundwork for editing printer groups by @davidzwa in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/50\r\n* Lay groundwork for user with roles by @davidzwa in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/51\r\n* Increase test coverage - tasks, services and host by @davidzwa in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/52\r\n* Remove current operations cache - useless cache by @davidzwa in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/53\r\n* Cleanup and prepare auth middleware for rbauth by @davidzwa in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/54\r\n* Prerelease fixes, client release and multi-arch docker build by @davidzwa in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/55\r\n* Update packages, use throttle message to send heartbeat to OP and other small fixes by @davidzwa in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/56\r\n* Cover server update service and clean the legacy code up by @davidzwa in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/57\r\n* Purge history controller, service and rename HistoryCache to HistoryStore by @davidzwa in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/58\r\n* Start testing history API by @davidzwa in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/59\r\n* Cover printer API by @davidzwa in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/60\r\n* Add helmet by @davidzwa in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/61\r\n* Bump validator from 13.6.0 to 13.7.0 in /client-vue by @dependabot in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/62\r\n* Expose OP API key with operator or admin role only for printer update by @davidzwa in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/63\r\n* Add ability to clear printer from group by @davidzwa in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/64\r\n* Release client 0.1.13 for server 0.0.4-pre1 by @davidzwa in https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/pull/65\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/3d-hub/3d-hub/compare/v0.0.3-pre2...0.0.4-pre1",
